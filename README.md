# This is my React Project I made while attending the Nucamp Coding Bootcamp
Hosted at [https://gleaming-elf-7a6c24.netlify.app/](https://gleaming-elf-7a6c24.netlify.app/)

It features a node.js backend and all movie and food data is hosted on MongoDB
Since the node.js portion is hosted on Render, it will sometimes take a moment to spin up to provided the data.
